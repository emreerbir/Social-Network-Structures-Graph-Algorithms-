# Social Network Structures Graph Algorithm
This C program works on graph with BFS algorithm. It calculates the strong connections between nodes and assigns them as a number. We then delete the strongest edge or edges with highest numbers. After this step, if we have a stop condition, we stop. Finally we find the most related groups and print them to the screen.
